# Artist Statement

When it comes to the topic of "timeless attraction", I think of imagination. A lot of artworks are related to the imagination, for instance, abstract art, art of impression. The history of art is long, but it is imagination that keeps our art and culture prosperous. Hence, I'd like to design an artwork with the theme of imagination.

Then I think of John Lennon's song "imagine". I think the songs of the Beatles are also timeless attraction artworks. So I combine those ideas together, plus the ideas of Glitch Art and Geneative Art.

You can imagine a lot of things when interacting with my artwork. For instance, I think I'm a hacker when fastly clicking on the keyboad to get a generative artwork of the Beatles' album. What's more, generative art requires your imagniation to enjoy.
